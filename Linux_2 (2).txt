2. Redhat ---> username: "ec2_user"

3. Amazon Linux ---> username: "ec2_user"

4. SUSE ---> username: "suse_linux"

ubuntu@ip-172-31-38-21:~$

username@ADDRESS_OF_THE_MACHINE

Linux global Commands:

to make the file from silent-mode to the insert mode you have to press the keyword "i"

	silent mode ---> insert mode ( you have to enter letter "i" )

	insert mode ---> silent mode ( you have to enter keyword "esc" )

	how to save the data ?

	After coming from the insert mode enter the command " :wq )

Advanced data:

14. How to create a users ?

More advanced:

19. File permissions:
	
d rwxr-xr-x ---> directory

- rw-rw-r-- ----> file

r = read
w = write
x = execute

rwx r-x r-x

1st part: the permissions of the user who created it

2nd part: it is the permissions for the group
